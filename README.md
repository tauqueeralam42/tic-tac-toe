# Tic Tac Toe Game

A web-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game provides information about the current player's turn, announces the game winner, or declares if the game ends in a tie. Players can start a new game with the click of a button once the current game concludes. Winning combinations are highlighted in green when a player wins, and no further moves are allowed after a win.

## Features

- **Current Turn Indicator:** Displays which player's turn it is (Player X or Player O).
- **Game Winner Announcement:** Highlights the winning combination in green and displays the winner.
- **Game Tie Declaration:** Announces if the game ends in a tie with no winner.
- **New Game Button:** Allows players to start a new game after finishing the current game.
- **Interactive Grid:** Players can click on the grid to make their moves until the game concludes.
